## Code 1
In this approach, we can use binary search to find which sum might be the best fit for the given number of splits, and once we find that, we can simply try to minimize that. The minimum largest number would be a single max element and largest would be sum of all of the elements.


## Code 2
In this approach we can iterate in a loop till we think we are done, minimize the split and move to another split. Although this approach proves to be costly.
